Procedural Programming: Focus is on process or action that a program takes. Program is typically a collection of functions.
                        Data is declared separately. Data is passed as arguments in function.

Object-Oriented Programming: Models software in terms of classes and objects.

Encapsulation: Object contains data AND operations that work on that data.
Information-hiding: Implementation-specific logic can be hidden.
Reusability: Easier to reuse classes in other applications.
Inheritance: Can create new classes in term of existing classes.
Polymorphism: Ability of object to take on multiple forms(parent class referring to child class). Any object that satisfies more than one IS-A relationship is polymorphic in nature.
